Sql for data analysis
## Hints / Mini Guide

To help you complete the SQL data analysis task, here are some useful concepts and techniques:

1. Basic SQL Clauses
   - SELECT: Choose the columns you want to retrieve.
   - WHERE: Filter rows based on conditions.
   - ORDER BY: Sort results by one or more columns.
   - GROUP BY: Aggregate data based on specific columns.

2. Joins
INNER JOIN: Returns records with matching values in both tables.
 LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table and matched ones from the right.
 RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table and matched ones from the left.

 3.Subqueries
 A subquery is a query nested within another query.
 Useful for filtering data, calculating values, or creating temporary result sets.

4. Aggregate Functions
  SUM(): Adds up values.
 AVG(): Calculates the average.
    COUNT(): Counts rows.
    MAX() / MIN(): Finds maximum or minimum values.

5. Views
    Use CREATE VIEW to store a query as a virtual table.
   Helpful for simplifying repeated analysis and hiding complexity.

6. Query Optimization
    Use EXPLAIN (in MySQL/PostgreSQL) to analyze queries.
    Create indexes on columns used in WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY for faster performance.
    Avoid SELECT * to reduce data load.

These hints should help you craft efficient and readable SQL queries to analyze your dataset.
